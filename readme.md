PHP Project using jQuery,Less,Bootstrap,animate


Project uses its own template system.
To add a content page you need to crate new php file in app/templates/content the loader.php will load it automatically into navbar 
and javascript allows to redirect to it by url


Project does not come with compilled css to maintain latest styles, so you have to compile them urself :)
_______________________________________
compile less/main.less to css/main.css in order for styles to work
